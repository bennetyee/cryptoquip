# cryptoquip

This repository contains a simple Rust program to help solve the
"Cryptoquip" newspaper puzzle.  This is syndicated by [King
Features](http://kingfeatures.com/) as [Sheffer Crossword with
Cryptoquip](http://kingfeatures.com/features/puzzlesandgames/sheffer-crossword/)
(a few days worth is available at
[cecildaily](http://www.cecildaily.com/diversions/cryptoquip/)).  This
is _not_ an automated solver, since that completely eliminates any fun
to be had.

The program is non-graphical.  The console mode commands are terse --
single letters -- but I found the user-interface to be quite
effective.  Type in `?` to get a list of commands.  The only painful
part of using it is that one has to actually type in the cryptogram --
using a camera to take an image and then performing optical character
recognition might be reasonable, but probably not worth the effort.
