# cryptoquip

This repository contains a simple Rust program to help solve the
"Cryptoquip" newspaper puzzle.  This is published at
[cecildaily](http://www.cecildaily.com/diversions/cryptoquip/) and
syndicated by many regional papers.

The program is non-graphical.  The console mode commands are terse --
single letters -- but I found the user-interface to be quite
effective.  The only painful part of using it is that one has to
actually type in the cryptogram -- using a camera to take an image and
then performing optical character recognition might be reasonable, but
probably not worth the effort.
